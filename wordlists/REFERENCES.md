# Wordlist & Payload References

The lists in this directory are intentionally compact. For full hunts pull from the
upstream collections below — they ship orders of magnitude more entries plus
context-specific lists (graphql, cloud, mobile, etc.) you can swap into ffuf.

## Suggested layout

```
$HOME/wordlists/
  OneListForAll/
  fuzz4bounty/
  PayloadsAllTheThings/
```

Set `WORDLIST_BASE=$HOME/wordlists` and most hunting scripts will pick them up.
