# Agent Reference — When to Use Each

## Methodology & Orchestration

| Agent | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| `@bb-methodology` | Start of every engagement. 12-phase pipeline: scope → auth → intel → recon → surface → hunt → deepthink → exploit → search → capture → validate → report. Selects mode (bounty/redteam/pentest/audit). |
| `@bug-bounty` | General bug bounty workflow. Program selection, duplicate detection, payout optimization. Use after scope is confirmed. |
| `credential-attack` (skill) | Load via `skill("credential-attack")` when a login endpoint is in scope and program policy permits password testing. 4-stage pipeline: wordlist-gen (cewler → hashcat rules) → breach-check (HIBP k-anonymity) → OSINT employees (theHarvester → username-anarchy) → spray (http-form / oauth / o365 / okta). |
| `@hunt-dispatch` / `@hunt-dispatcher` | When you have a target but don't know which hunt agent to use. Fingerprints tech stack, routes to the correct agent. |
| `@redteam-mindset` | Before any engagement. Sets operational discipline, anti-patterns, burnout avoidance. Read once per engagement. |
| `@web2-vuln-classes` | Reference for 22 bug classes with root causes, bypass tables, exploit techniques. Use when learning a new vuln class or writing reports. |

## Analysis (Read-only, Cross-Phase)

| Agent | When to use | Input needed |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `analyze` | Before auth or recon. Navigates to target URL, analyzes page structure, classifies auth mechanism (OIDC/OAuth/SAML/Form/Magic link), captures cookies/storage, fingerprints tech stack. Saves structured report as deliverable for downstream agents. Reusable across all phases. | URL to analyze |
| `browser-auth` | After `analyze` completes. Attempts browser-based authentication using the deliverable — form login, OAuth, SSO, auto signup, MFA, anti-bot bypass. Saves cookies/storage for downstream recon. | `auth_analysis` deliverable from `analyze` |

## Recon & Asset Discovery

| Agent | When to use | Input needed |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| `@web2-recon` | Start of every web target. Subdomain enum, crawling, endpoint discovery, directory fuzz, JS analysis. | Domain name |
| `@offensive-osint` | Identity mapping, breached credentials, email/phone/social enumeration, org footprint. | Company name, email, username |
| `@osint-methodology` | Source verification, data correlation, persona tracking, geolocation. | Target identity/org |
| `@hunt-source-leak` | When you find `.git`, `.env`, backup files, or debug endpoints. Source map analysis, s3 bucket leaks. | URL or domain |
| `@hunt-subdomain` | When recon finds stale CNAMEs, dangling DNS. Subdomain takeover validation. | CNAME records |

## Exploitation

| Agent | When to use | Input |
