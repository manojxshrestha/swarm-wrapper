2. Configuration and Deployment Management (WSTG-CONF)
3. Identity Management (WSTG-IDNT)
4. Authentication (WSTG-ATHN)
5. Authorization (WSTG-ATHZ)
6. Session Management (WSTG-SESS)
7. Input Validation (WSTG-INPV)
8. Error Handling (WSTG-ERRH)
9. Cryptography (WSTG-CRYP)
10. Client-Side (WSTG-CLNT)

### Skipped Tests (with reasons)

<!-- Skipped tests with documented reasons are inserted here by generate_report -->

### Tests Not Attempted

<!-- List of test IDs that were not executed during this engagement -->

## Detailed Findings

<!-- Findings are inserted here by the generate_report tool, sorted by severity -->

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical/High)
- Address all Critical and High findings immediately
- Prioritize findings that allow unauthorized access or data exposure

### Short-Term (Medium)
- Remediate Medium findings within the next sprint/release cycle
- Review and harden configurations

### Long-Term (Low/Informational)
- Address Low findings as part of ongoing security improvements
- Consider Informational findings for defense-in-depth hardening
