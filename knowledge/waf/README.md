# Awesome WAF - Training Data

Extracted from [0xInfection/Awesome-WAF](https://github.com/0xInfection/Awesome-WAF) and structured as training data compatible with the Swarm project format.

## Overview

This dataset contains comprehensive knowledge about Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) from an offensive security perspective. It is organized into:

- **waf-knowledge-base/** - Categorized WAF knowledge (like Swarm's knowledge/wstg/)
  - `01-detection-methodology/` - How to detect and fingerprint WAFs
  - `02-waf-fingerprints/` - Detection signatures for 110+ WAF vendors
  - `03-evasion-techniques/` - 21 categories of WAF evasion techniques
  - `04-known-bypasses/` - Documented payloads for bypassing 24+ WAF vendors
  - `05-tools-and-research/` - Tools, research papers, presentations, and scripts
- **skills/** (moved to `skills/waf-*/`) - Structured skill modules (like Swarm's skills/)
- **configs/** - Configuration templates
