# WSTG-INPV-17: Testing for Host Header Injection

## Summary

Host Header Injection occurs when an application trusts the value of the HTTP Host header for security-sensitive operations without proper validation. The Host header is user-controllable and can be manipulated to influence application behavior. Common attack scenarios include password reset poisoning (where the reset link contains an attacker-controlled domain), web cache poisoning (where the cached response reflects the injected host), and server-side request routing manipulation. Applications that generate absolute URLs using the Host header value, or that route requests based on virtual hosting, are particularly vulnerable.

## Test Objectives

- Determine if the application uses the Host header to generate URLs or make routing decisions
- Test if the Host header value can be manipulated to inject an attacker-controlled domain
- Identify password reset poisoning, cache poisoning, and SSRF via host header injection
- Assess whether alternative host headers (X-Forwarded-Host, X-Host) are processed

## Prerequisites

- Target application is accessible through Docker pentest container
- Application has features that generate absolute URLs (password reset, email links, canonical URLs)
- Docker pentest container capturing traffic
- Understanding of the application's virtual hosting and reverse proxy configuration

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Identify Host Header Usage

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to identify features that generate absolute URLs:
   - Password reset functionality
   - Email notifications with links
   - Canonical URL meta tags
   - Sitemaps
   - OAuth/OpenID Connect redirect URIs
   - API documentation with base URLs
2. Use `save to manual-review file` for each endpoint that generates URLs

### Step 2: Test Basic Host Header Manipulation

**CLI Actions:**
Use `curl` to send requests with a modified Host header:

**Replace Host entirely:**
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: evil.com
```

Check if the response contains `evil.com` in any generated URLs, links, or meta tags.

**Inject into password reset:**
```
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: evil.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=victim@target.com
```

If the password reset email contains a link like `https://evil.com/reset?token=xxx`, the attacker can steal the reset token.

### Step 3: Test with Duplicate Host Headers

**CLI Actions:**
Use `curl` with two Host headers to see which one the application uses:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Host: evil.com
```

Some servers use the first Host header for routing but the second for URL generation, or vice versa.

### Step 4: Test X-Forwarded-Host and Alternative Headers

**CLI Actions:**
Use `curl` to test alternative host headers that may override the Host:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Host: evil.com
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Server: evil.com
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Original-URL: /admin
X-Rewrite-URL: /admin
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
Forwarded: host=evil.com
```

Check if any of these headers override the Host value in generated URLs.

### Step 5: Test Password Reset Poisoning

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to trigger a password reset with a manipulated host:

```
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: evil.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=victim@target.com
```

```
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=victim@target.com
```

2. Check the password reset email (if you control the victim email address) to see if the reset link points to `evil.com`
3. If so, a real attacker would receive the token when the victim clicks the link

### Step 6: Test Web Cache Poisoning via Host Header

**CLI Actions:**
Use `curl` to test if responses with injected host values get cached:

```
GET /static/page HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-Host: evil.com
```

If the response reflects `evil.com` and includes cache headers (`Cache-Control`, `X-Cache: HIT`), subsequent users visiting the same page will receive the poisoned response.

1. Send the request with the injected host
2. Send a normal request to the same URL:
   ``
   GET /static/page HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
3. Check if the normal request returns the poisoned response (with `evil.com` in the content)

### Step 7: Test Host Header with Port and Special Characters

**CLI Actions:**
Use `curl` to test edge cases in host header parsing:

**Port injection:**
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com:evil.com
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com:@evil.com
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com:80@evil.com
```

**Absolute URL in request line:**
```
GET https://evil.com/ HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com
```

**Host with trailing dot:**
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com.
```

**Host with space injection:**
```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: target.com evil.com
```

### Step 8: Test Server-Side Routing Manipulation

**CLI Actions:**
Use `curl` to test if the Host header affects internal routing:

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1
```

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: internal-app.local
```

```
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: backend-service
```

If the application returns different content for different Host values, it may be possible to access internal virtual hosts or backend services.

check if Burp has detected any host header injection issues.

## Detection Criteria

A finding should be logged when:
- The Host header value is reflected in generated URLs, links, or page content
- Password reset emails contain attacker-controlled domain in the reset link
- Alternative host headers (X-Forwarded-Host) override the Host value in URL generation
- Web cache poisoning is achievable through host header manipulation
- Internal virtual hosts or services are accessible via host header manipulation

## Severity Assessment

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| Password reset token theft via host header poisoning | High |
| Web cache poisoning serves malicious content to all users | High |
| Access to internal services via host header routing | High |
| Host header reflected in URLs but no direct exploitation path | Medium |
| X-Forwarded-Host overrides Host but limited to informational | Medium |
| Host header reflected in meta tags only (limited impact) | Low |
| Different Host values return different content without security impact | Informational |

## Remediation

- Do not use the Host header to generate URLs in security-sensitive contexts
- Use a server-side configured base URL for generating absolute URLs (password resets, emails, canonical URLs)
- Validate the Host header against an allowlist of permitted values
- Ignore X-Forwarded-Host and similar headers unless explicitly required by trusted proxies
- Configure the web server to reject requests with unrecognized Host header values
- Use a default virtual host that returns an error for unrecognized Host headers
- For password resets, hardcode the application URL rather than deriving it from the request
- Implement cache key normalization that includes the Host header
- Set `Cache-Control: private` on responses that reflect the Host value
