# WSTG-INFO-02: Fingerprint Web Server

## Summary

Determining the type and version of a running web server allows testers to identify known vulnerabilities and appropriate exploits. Web servers reveal identity through HTTP headers, error pages, and behavioral differences.

## Test Objectives

- Determine the type and version of the web server
- Identify the underlying operating system and technology stack
- Discover known vulnerabilities associated with the identified versions

## Prerequisites


## Test Steps

### Step 1: Analyze HTTP Response Headers

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to send a simple GET request to the target root:
   ``
   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
2. Examine response headers for server identification

**Headers to Look For:**
- `Server` - Often reveals web server type and version (e.g., `Apache/2.4.41`, `nginx/1.18.0`)
- `X-Powered-By` - Reveals backend technology (e.g., `PHP/7.4.3`, `ASP.NET`)
- `X-AspNet-Version` - .NET framework version
- `X-Generator` - CMS identification (e.g., `WordPress 5.x`)
- `Via` - Proxy server information
- `X-Server` - Additional server info in some configurations

### Step 2: Probe with Different HTTP Methods

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` with an OPTIONS request:
   ``
   OPTIONS / HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
2. Use `curl` with a HEAD request:
   ``
   HEAD / HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
3. Use `curl` with an invalid method:
   ``
   FAKEVERB / HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
4. Compare error page formats and headers - different servers produce distinct error pages

### Step 3: Trigger Error Pages

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to request a non-existent page:
   ``
   GET /this-page-does-not-exist-12345 HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
2. Use `curl` with a very long URL (8000+ characters) to trigger 414 errors
3. Use `curl` with malformed headers to trigger 400 errors

**What to Look For:**
- Default error page templates differ by server type
- Error messages may include version strings
- Stack traces may reveal technology stack

### Step 4: Check Common Server-Specific Paths

**CLI Actions:**
Send `curl` for each of these paths:

```
/server-status       (Apache)
/server-info         (Apache)
/.htaccess           (Apache)
/nginx_status        (Nginx)
/web.config          (IIS)
/elmah.axd           (ASP.NET)
/trace.axd           (ASP.NET)
/wp-login.php        (WordPress)
/administrator/      (Joomla)
/user/login          (Drupal)
```

### Step 5: HTTP Header Order Analysis

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` and note the order of response headers
2. Different servers return headers in characteristic orders:
   - Apache typically: `Date, Server, Content-Type`
   - Nginx typically: `Server, Date, Content-Type`
   - IIS typically: `Content-Type, Server, Date`

## Payloads

Not applicable - this is a passive/semi-passive fingerprinting test.

## Detection Criteria

A finding should be logged when:
- Exact server version is disclosed (e.g., `Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)`)
- Backend technology versions are revealed (e.g., `PHP/7.4.3`)
- The identified version has known CVEs
- Default or debug pages are accessible

## Severity Assessment

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| Server version with known critical CVEs | Medium |
| Exact server and OS version disclosed | Low |
| Generic server type identified (no version) | Informational |
| Technology stack versions revealed (PHP, .NET) | Low |

## Remediation

- Configure server to suppress or customize the `Server` header
- Remove `X-Powered-By` and similar technology disclosure headers
- Customize error pages to not reveal server identity
- Disable server status/info pages in production
- Keep server software updated to latest stable versions
