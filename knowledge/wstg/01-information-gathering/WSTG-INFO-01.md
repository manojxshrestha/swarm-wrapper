# WSTG-INFO-01: Conduct Search Engine Discovery and Reconnaissance

## Summary

Search engines index publicly available content. Sensitive pages, error messages, configuration files, and internal resources may be inadvertently exposed and discoverable through search engine queries (Google Dorking).

## Test Objectives

- Identify what sensitive design and configuration information of the application, system, or organization is exposed directly or indirectly through search engines
- Discover exposed files, directories, login portals, error pages, and other sensitive resources

## Prerequisites

- Target domain is known

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Identify the Target Domain and Subdomains

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to send a request to the target domain and observe the response headers
2. Check `curl` for any redirects or alternate domains referenced in responses

**Manual Checks:**
- Note all domains and subdomains observed in responses (e.g., from `Location` headers, `Content-Security-Policy`, links in HTML)

### Step 2: Search Engine Dorking

Construct and test search queries to find exposed resources. Use the following dork patterns against the target domain:

**CLI Actions:**
1. For each discovered URL from dorking, use `curl` to verify accessibility
2. Use `save to manual-review file` for interesting endpoints that need further investigation

**Google Dork Queries to Test:**
```
site:target.com
site:target.com filetype:pdf
site:target.com filetype:xml
site:target.com filetype:conf
site:target.com filetype:env
site:target.com filetype:log
site:target.com filetype:sql
site:target.com filetype:bak
site:target.com inurl:admin
site:target.com inurl:login
site:target.com inurl:config
site:target.com inurl:api
site:target.com intitle:"index of"
site:target.com ext:php intitle:"phpinfo()"
site:target.com "error" OR "warning" OR "stack trace"
site:target.com "password" OR "username" OR "credentials"
```

### Step 3: Check robots.txt and sitemap.xml

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to fetch `https://target.com/robots.txt`
2. Use `curl` to fetch `https://target.com/sitemap.xml`
3. Use `curl` to fetch `https://target.com/sitemap_index.xml`
4. For each disallowed path in robots.txt, use `curl` to check if it's accessible

**What to Look For:**
- Disallowed paths in robots.txt that reveal internal structure
- Sitemaps listing non-public or admin pages
- Sensitive file paths or backup directories

### Step 4: Check Cached Versions and Web Archives

**Manual Checks:**
- Check Google Cache for older versions of pages
- Check the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) for historical content
- Look for removed pages that may still reveal information

## Payloads

Not applicable for this test - this is a passive reconnaissance test.

## Detection Criteria

A finding should be logged when:
- Sensitive files are accessible via URLs found through search engine queries (config files, backups, logs, SQL dumps)
- Admin interfaces or internal pages are publicly accessible
- robots.txt reveals sensitive directory structures
- Error pages or debug information are indexed by search engines
- Credentials, API keys, or tokens are exposed in cached pages

## Severity Assessment

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| Credentials, API keys, or tokens found in indexed pages | High |
| Admin interfaces discoverable and accessible | Medium |
| Internal directory structure revealed via robots.txt | Low |
| Generic information disclosure (software versions, paths) | Informational |

## Remediation

- Remove sensitive files from web-accessible directories
- Use proper robots.txt directives but don't rely on them for security
- Implement access controls for admin and internal pages
- Use `noindex` meta tags or `X-Robots-Tag` headers for sensitive pages
- Regularly audit search engine results for exposed content
- Request removal of sensitive cached content from search engines
