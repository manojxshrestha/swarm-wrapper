# WSTG-ATHZ-02: Testing for Bypassing Authorization Schema

## Summary

Authorization bypass occurs when an attacker accesses resources or functionality that should be restricted. This can happen through URL manipulation, forced browsing, parameter modification, or exploiting inconsistent access controls.

## Test Objectives

- Assess if horizontal or vertical authorization controls can be bypassed
- Test if unauthenticated users can access protected resources
- Identify inconsistencies in access control enforcement

## Prerequisites

- Multiple test accounts at different privilege levels (user, moderator, admin)
- Knowledge of the application's role structure
- Docker pentest container capturing traffic from different user sessions

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Map Role-Based Access

**CLI Actions:**
1. Log in as admin and browse all functionality. Use `curl` to capture all admin requests
2. Log in as regular user and browse all functionality. Use `curl` to capture all user requests
3. Compare the two sets of URLs and identify admin-only endpoints

### Step 2: Test Forced Browsing (Unauthenticated)

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to request protected pages **without** any session cookies:
   ``
   GET /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
2. Test each admin endpoint without authentication
3. Check if the response returns content, redirects, or returns 403

### Step 3: Test Horizontal Authorization Bypass

**CLI Actions:**
1. Using User A's session, use `curl` to access User B's resources:
   ``
   GET /api/profile/user-b-id HTTP/1.1
   Cookie: session=<user_a_session>
   ``
2. Test with different methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) as some may have inconsistent controls

### Step 4: Test Vertical Authorization Bypass

**CLI Actions:**
1. Capture an admin action request from the admin session
2. Use `save to manual-review file` with this request
3. Replace the admin session cookie with a regular user's session cookie
4. Use `curl` to test if the action is still performed
5. Test admin API endpoints:
   ``
   POST /api/admin/create-user HTTP/1.1
   Cookie: session=<regular_user_session>
   Content-Type: application/json

   {"username":"newadmin","role":"admin"}
   ``

### Step 5: Test Path Manipulation

**CLI Actions:**
Use `curl` to test URL variations that may bypass path-based access controls:

```
GET /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
GET /ADMIN/dashboard HTTP/1.1
GET /admin/./dashboard HTTP/1.1
GET /admin/../admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
GET //admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
GET /admin%2fdashboard HTTP/1.1
GET /%61dmin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
GET /admin/dashboard;.js HTTP/1.1
GET /admin/dashboard%00 HTTP/1.1
GET /admin/dashboard/ HTTP/1.1
GET /admin/dashboard? HTTP/1.1
```

### Step 6: Test HTTP Method Bypass

**CLI Actions:**
If GET returns 403, test other methods with `curl`:
```
POST /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
PUT /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
PATCH /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
HEAD /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
OPTIONS /admin/dashboard HTTP/1.1
```

## Payloads

### URL Path Bypass Variations
```
/admin/dashboard
/Admin/Dashboard
/ADMIN/DASHBOARD
/admin/./dashboard
/admin/../admin/dashboard
//admin//dashboard
/admin/dashboard/
/admin/dashboard/.
/admin/dashboard%00
/admin/dashboard%0d%0a
/admin/dashboard;.css
/admin/dashboard;.js
/admin/dashboard..;/
/.;/admin/dashboard
```

### Header-Based Bypasses
```
X-Original-URL: /admin/dashboard
X-Rewrite-URL: /admin/dashboard
X-Custom-IP-Authorization: 127.0.0.1
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
```

## Detection Criteria

A finding should be logged when:
- Protected resources are accessible without authentication
- A lower-privileged user can access higher-privilege functionality
- Path manipulation bypasses access controls
- HTTP method changes bypass access controls
- Header manipulation grants unauthorized access

## Severity Assessment

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| Admin functionality accessible by regular users | Critical |
| Unauthenticated access to admin features | Critical |
| Horizontal access to other users' sensitive data | High |
| Path bypass accesses restricted content | High |
| Method bypass reveals restricted information (read-only) | Medium |

## Remediation

- Implement server-side authorization checks on every request
- Use a centralized authorization framework, not scattered checks
- Deny by default - require explicit grants for each role/resource
- Normalize URL paths before applying access controls
- Enforce authorization regardless of HTTP method
- Log and alert on authorization failures
