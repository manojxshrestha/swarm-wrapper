# WSTG-CRYP-01: Testing for Weak Transport Layer Security

## Summary

Transport Layer Security (TLS) protects data in transit between clients and servers. Weak TLS configurations (outdated protocols, weak cipher suites, invalid certificates) can allow interception, decryption, or manipulation of sensitive data.

## Test Objectives

- Verify TLS/SSL protocol versions supported
- Identify weak cipher suites
- Check certificate validity and configuration
- Assess overall TLS security posture

## Prerequisites

- Target is accessible over HTTPS
- Docker pentest container capturing traffic

## Test Steps

### Step 1: Check TLS Protocol Support

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to connect to the target over HTTPS and observe the TLS handshake details in Burp
2. Note which TLS versions are negotiated

**What to Check:**
- SSLv2 - Must NOT be supported (critically insecure)
- SSLv3 - Must NOT be supported (POODLE vulnerability)
- TLS 1.0 - Should NOT be supported (deprecated)
- TLS 1.1 - Should NOT be supported (deprecated)
- TLS 1.2 - Acceptable with strong cipher suites
- TLS 1.3 - Best, should be supported

### Step 2: Analyze Response Headers

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to request the target over HTTPS:
   ``
   GET / HTTP/1.1
   Host: target.com
   ``
2. Check for security headers:
   - `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS)
   - `Public-Key-Pins` (HPKP) - deprecated but check if present
   - `Expect-CT` - Certificate Transparency

### Step 3: Check Certificate Details

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to connect to the target
2. Burp will capture certificate details

**What to Check:**
- Certificate is not expired
- Certificate is issued by a trusted CA
- Subject/SAN matches the domain name
- Key size is adequate (RSA >= 2048 bits, ECDSA >= 256 bits)
- Signature algorithm is not SHA-1

### Step 4: Test for Mixed Content

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to check for HTTP (non-HTTPS) requests being made from HTTPS pages
2. Look for resources loaded over HTTP (scripts, stylesheets, images, iframes)
3. Active mixed content (scripts, iframes) is especially dangerous

### Step 5: Check HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

**CLI Actions:**
1. Use `curl` to request the target over HTTP:
   ``
   GET / HTTP/1.0
   Host: target.com
   ``
2. Check if a redirect to HTTPS occurs
3. Check if HSTS is set with adequate max-age (at least 6 months / 15768000)

### Step 6: Test HSTS Configuration

**CLI Actions:**
If HSTS header is present, verify:
```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

- `max-age` should be at least 15768000 (6 months), ideally 31536000 (1 year)
- `includeSubDomains` should be present
- `preload` is recommended for maximum protection

## Payloads

Not applicable - this is a configuration analysis test.

## Detection Criteria

A finding should be logged when:
- SSLv3, TLS 1.0, or TLS 1.1 are supported
- Weak cipher suites are offered (RC4, DES, 3DES, NULL, EXPORT)
- Certificate is self-signed, expired, or has wrong hostname
- HSTS header is missing
- Mixed content is present (HTTP resources on HTTPS pages)
- No HTTP to HTTPS redirect
- Certificate key size < 2048 bits (RSA) or uses SHA-1 signatures

## Severity Assessment

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| SSLv2 or SSLv3 supported | High |
| TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 supported | Medium |
| Weak cipher suites (NULL, EXPORT, RC4, DES) | Medium |
| Missing HSTS header | Medium |
| Expired or invalid certificate | Medium |
| Active mixed content (scripts over HTTP) | Medium |
| Self-signed certificate (non-internal) | Medium |
| HSTS with short max-age (<6 months) | Low |
| Passive mixed content (images over HTTP) | Low |
| SHA-1 certificate signatures | Low |
| TLS 1.3 not supported (but TLS 1.2 available) | Informational |

## Remediation

- Disable SSLv2, SSLv3, TLS 1.0, and TLS 1.1
- Enable TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 only
- Use strong cipher suites (AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Implement HSTS with max-age >= 31536000 and includeSubDomains
- Ensure valid certificates from trusted CAs
- Fix all mixed content issues
- Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS with 301
- Use certificates with RSA >= 2048 bits or ECDSA >= 256 bits
- Consider HSTS preloading
